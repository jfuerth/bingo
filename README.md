# Bingo Card Maker

Just fill the bingo_names.txt file with whatever values you like
then run `java -cp . BingoCard`. You will see a preview. To create
PDF (or print directly), choose how many different cards you need
then press print. Use your Operating System's printer chooser to
print to a real printer or save to PDF.

Have fun!
