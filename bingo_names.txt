After the Ball
Baby Face
By the Light of the Silvery Moon
Cuddle Up a Little Closer
Down By the Old Mill Stream
Gimme a Little Kiss
I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles
If You Were the Only Girl
Let a Smile Be Your Umbrella
Marching Along Together

Red Sails in the Sunset
Somewhere, My Love
The Band Played On
Way Down Upon the Swanee River

Did You Ever See a Dream Walking
Five Foot Two, Eyes of Blue
I Dream of Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair
I've Got Sixpence
In the Shade of the Old Apple Tree
Let the Sunshine In
Meet Me in St. Louis
Peg O' My Heart
Sidewalks of New York
Take Me Out to the Ball Game
Till We Meet Again
You Are My Sunshine
